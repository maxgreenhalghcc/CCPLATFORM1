# v1.0.1-rc.1 â€“ Release candidate

## Highlights
- Added `/v1/status` (API) and `/status` (recipe) endpoints with version, commit, uptime, and Sentry enablement to support production smoke checks.
- Enabled correlation-aware Sentry transactions across quiz submission, checkout creation, order fulfilment, and admin metrics flows.
- Hardened logging with request-id and user-id metadata plus redaction for sensitive headers and payloads.
- Surfaced feature flags (payment, beta badge) via environment variables and updated the web app to honour them.
- Extended the deployment workflow to accept tagged images, materialise production env splits, and run Prisma migrations on boot.
- Documented SLOs, release runbook updates, and the production smoke checklist for launch readiness.

## Operational notes
- Provide `SENTRY_DSN_API`, `SENTRY_DSN_RECIPE`, and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` secrets for staging/production or leave blank to disable telemetry.
- Populate `FEATURE_ENABLE_PAYMENT`, `FEATURE_SHOW_BETA_BADGE`, and their `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` counterparts per tenant before deployment.
- `scripts/smoke.sh` now accepts an optional expected version argument and validates `/v1/status` including the Sentry flag.
- Use `gh workflow run deploy.yml -f environment=<env> -f tag=v1.0.1-rc.1` to promote the release candidate; rerun with a previous tag for rollback.

## Known follow-ups
- Expand uptime monitoring to cover the public web frontend explicitly.
- Incorporate Stripe webhook replay automation for smoke environments.
- Add dashboards for the Sentry transactions introduced in this release.
